âœ… 3. React Frontend: Example Fetch Usage
In React, to get the education section:

js
Copy code
useEffect(() => {
  fetch("http://localhost:4000/education")
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(data => setEducation(data));
}, []);
Or for work projects:

fetch("http://localhost:4000/work")
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(data => setProjects(data));
ðŸ§  Bonus: Hosting Images
You can:

Store your images in /public/images/ in React.

Or host them on Cloudinary, S3, or a GitHub repo with public URLs.

Just link to them via the API (image: 'https://cdn.example.com/project.png').
